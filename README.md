### Hi thereðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:  

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a software developer and my main focus is on refactoring legacy codes. I specialize in converting PHP codes to Golang, but I also have an interest in developing game mods such as Stellaris.  
- ðŸŒ± I am always eager to learn new skills and I am currently focused on learning TDD/BDD/DDD.  
- ðŸ“« If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to email me at stug_iii@foxmail.com.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a "big fan" of PHP and I believe it is the greatest programming language out there!
